Files:
	FAMachine.java:
	    Builds the Finite Automaton Machine
	NFA.java:
	    Constructor for data type
	RegularExpressions.txt:
	     A file that holds the example regular expressions that were given out in class
	README

Description:
The files listed above, when complied and built, will build a Finite Automaton.

Build environment:$java -version
                  java version "1.8.0_51"

To build and run on WSU lab machines log into the linux machine. Then change the
directory you are in into the directory where you have opened and stored the files
above.
The following commands will compile and run the program:
            $javac FAMachine.java NFA.java
                This will compile my .java files into .class files
            $java FAMachine <filename.txt>
                This will run the program with the text file of
                your liking and print out an NFA transition table
                with the start and final states indicated.

Example of what the out put should be:
            $javac javac FAMachine.java NFA.java
            $java FAMachine RegularExpressions.txt
            Regular Expression : ab+
                 (q1,a) -----> q2
                 (q2,E) -----> q6 <- F
                 (q3,b) -----> q4
                 (q4,E) -----> q6 <- F
            S -> (q5,E) -----> q1
            S -> (q5,E) -----> q3

            In this example q5 is the start state and q6 in the final state.
